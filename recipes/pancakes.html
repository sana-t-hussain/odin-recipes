    <h3>An easy pancake batter recipe with tips on how to make the best pancakes every time.</h3>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>100g plain flour</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>300ml milk</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sunflower or vegetable oil (plus a little extra for frying)</li>
        <li>raspberries to serve (optional)</li>
        <li>blueberries to serve (optional)</li>
        <li>caster sugar to serve (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Put 100g plain flour, 2 large eggs, 300ml milk, 1 tbsp sunflower or vegetable oil and a pinch of salt into a 
            bowl or large jug, then whisk to a smooth batter. This should be similar in consistency to single cream.</li>
        <li>Set aside for 30 mins to rest if you have time, or start cooking straight away.</li>
        <li>Set a medium frying pan or crÃªpe pan over a medium heat and carefully wipe it with some oiled kitchen paper.</li>
        <li>When hot, cook your pancakes for 1 min on each side until golden, using around half a ladleful of batter 
            per pancake. Keep them warm in a low oven as you make the rest.</li>
        <li>Serve with raspberries, blueberries and caster sugar, or your favourite filling. <em>Once cold, you can layer 
            the pancakes between baking parchment, then wrap in cling film and freeze for up to two months.</em></li>
    </ol>
