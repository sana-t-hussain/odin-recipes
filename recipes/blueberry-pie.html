    <h3 #Description></h3>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>300g plain flour plus extra, for dusting</li>
        <li>165g butter frozen</li>
        <li>750g fresh blueberries</li>
        <li>150g caster sugar plus 1 tbsp for sprinkling</li>
        <li>40g cornflour</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 lemon zested and juiced</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 tbsp milk</li>
        <li>ice cream or whipped cream to serve</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Tip the flour into a large bowl with Â½ tsp fine salt. Coarsely grate the butter onto a piece of baking
            parchment. Set aside 2 tbsp grated butter, then tip the rest into the flour. Using a table knife, mix the flour 
            and butter together. Add 3 tbsp very cold water and mix together to form a dough. Knead very briefly, then divide 
            into two equal balls. Pat into 2cm deep discs, wrap and chill for at least 1 hr.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, stir together the blueberries, sugar, cornflour, cinnamon, lemon zest and juice. Set aside for at least
            1 hr until the sugar dissolves.</li>
        <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll one pastry disc out into a 26cm round and use to line a 22cm pie dish, ensuring
            the pastry slightly overhangs the edge. Spoon in the blueberry mixture then scatter over the reserved grated butter.</li>
        <li>Roll the remaining pastry into a 24cm round and cut into 10 strips. Arrange five strips vertically across the pie 
            then either weave or simply place the remaining strips horizontally on top to create a lattice. Trim any excess
            overhanging the dish, then crimp the edges together firmly to make a fluted crust. Chill the pie for at least 30 mins.</li>
        <li>Heat the oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5. Beat together the egg and milk and brush over the pastry. Sprinkle with the 
            remaining 1 tbsp sugar, then put the dish on a baking tray. Bake for 1 hr, keeping an eyes on it and covering loosely 
            with foil once the pastry is golden brown.</li>
        <li>Leave the pie to cool to room temperature (the filling thickens as it cools). <em>Will keep chilled for up to three days.</em> 
            Slice and serve warm or cold with ice cream or whipped cream.</li>
    </ol>
